## Custom Colour Palettes for Tailwind

You already know, you can customise your [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) config to include your personal/custom features. Here you will find already made colour palettes to either set as the default color palette or extending the default Tailwind theme. Nothing too fancy! Just here to save you time you'd take to compile these palettes for a Tailwind config ;)

1. [Material Design 2](MATERIAL_DESIGN_2.md) (Google)
2. [Carbon Design](CARBON_DESIGN.md) (IBM)

- Just append the color object to your tailwind configuration file and then build once done.
- Happy customisation :)
