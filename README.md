## Material Design Colours for Tailwind

As you might be aware, you can customise your [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com) and include your personal/custom features.

In case you want to include [material design colors](https://material.io/resources/color/) for your tailwind UI, this [repo]() will get you up and running in no time. 

- Just append the color object to your tailwind configuration file and then build once done.
- Everyone is happy :)
